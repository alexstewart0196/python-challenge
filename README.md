# python-challenge

For this module I really tried to put my googling and info gathering skills to the test. Upon researching the concepts for this project, I consistently found resources suggesting use of Pandas. You will see upon review that my Python script contains heavy use of the Pandas library. I started this assignment before beginning the Pandas segment in class, and essentially tought myself to navigate the use of the library. My teacher/TA were aware of this as I sought help in office hours, and the prompt for the module does not prohibit the use of Pandas. I put a lot of work into this assignment and I beleive my output is completely correct. I hope use of this method does not effect my grade, but either way I feel like I got more out of this project than any other so far and I am proud of my final product.

The links to my research are below. I also had a tutoring session with Aisha where she helped me with my final formatting of PyPoll, as well as output to txt file.
